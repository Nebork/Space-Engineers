; Nebork's Renaming Script

; This script gives every functional block on this grid a uniform naming.
; You can also set a lot of the properties at once.
; The script uses a tag system, you can choose everything!
; A list of all tags with description is given below.
; An example is given at 
; https://github.com/Nebork/Space-Engineers/blob/main/Renaming_Script/Renaming_Script/Example%20Custom%20Data.txt
; I advise to save these custom data once you are satisfied.

[Global Settings]

; Defines the name of the grid which shall be renamed.
; If empty uses the grid of this programmable block.
GridName = 

; Decides if all subgrids shall be renamed uniformely. [true/false]
; USE WITH CAUTION!
WorkOnSubgrids = false

; Sets a prefix and postfix(suffix) for every block.
; Leave empty if nothing is wanted.
; I prefer unique prefixes for every grid.
Prefix = [SHP]
Postfix = 

; If true, adds leading zeros to numberings of blocks if needed.
; This leads to better sorting in the terminal. [true/false]
LeadingZeros = true

; If true, adds prefix and postfix(suffix) to skipped groups.
; [true/false]
SimpleSkip = false


; ============================
[Block Settings]
; ============================

; Write your wanted tags behind every block type the way you like it
; Order of tags is not required.

; H: Show on HUD
; T: Show in terminal
; I: Show in inventory
; N: Number all blocks of this type
; R: Renames the base name to a given string in quotation marks
; B: Show in toolbar config
; S: Skips the whole block type. No block will be touched!

; Example: Refinery = -I -N -R "Smelter"
; All refineries are shown in the inventory and numbered.
; They are called "Smelter 1", "Smelter 2", ...
