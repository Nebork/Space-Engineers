; Nebork's Renaming Script, v.1.0.0

; This script gives every functional block on this grid a uniform naming.
; You can also set a lot of the properties at once.
; The script uses a tag system, you can choose everything!
; A list of all tags with description is given below.
; I advise to save these custom data once you are satisfied.
; An example is given at:
; https://github.com/Nebork/Space-Engineers/tree/main/Renaming_Script/Renaming_Script

; If you run the script with an argument, the script will interpret
; it as the GridName. Adding a second argument (separated by a ",")
; will define it's prefix.

; ============================
[Global Settings]
; ============================

; Defines the name of the grid which shall be renamed.
; If empty uses the grid of this programmable block.
GridName = 

; Decides if all subgrids shall be renamed uniformely. [true/false]
; USE WITH CAUTION!
WorkOnSubgrids = false

; Sets a prefix and suffix for every block.
; Leave empty if nothing is wanted.
; I prefer unique prefixes for every grid.
Prefix = [SHP]
Suffix = 

; If true, adds leading zeros to numberings of blocks if needed.
; This leads to better sorting in the terminal. [true/false]
LeadingZeros = true

; If true, adds only prefix and suffix to skipped groups.
; [true/false]
SoftSkip = true

; ============================
[Block Settings]
; ============================

; Write your wanted tags behind every block type the way you like it.
; Order of tags is not required.

; B: Show in toolbar config
; H: Show on HUD
; I: Show in inventory
; N: Number all blocks of this type
; R: Renames the base name to a given string in quotation marks
; S: Skips the whole block type. No block will be touched!
; T: Show in terminal

; Example: Refinery = -I -N -R "Smelter"
; All refineries are shown in the inventory and numbered.
; They are called "Smelter 1", "Smelter 2", ...
