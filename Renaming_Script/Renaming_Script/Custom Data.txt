[Nebork's Renaming Script]

; With this script it is possible to set a naming basis for an entire ship or a station at once and have all of the blocks named and set properly.
; It uses a tag system, meaning after every type of functional block you give the tags of how you want them to be named and which functions to set.
; A list of all tags with description is given below

; ------------------------------------------------------

; Defines the name of the grid which shall be renamed. If empty uses the grid of this programmable block.
GridName = 

; Decides if all subgrids shall be renamed uniformely. [true/false]
; USE WITH CAUTION!
WorkOnSubgrids = false

; Sets a pre-/postfix for every block. Advised to be different for every ship/station to properly identify every block. Leave empty if nothing is wanted.
Prefix = [HRP]
Postfix = 

; If true, adds leading zeros to numberings if the number of items is greater than 10. Leads to better sorting in terminal. [true/false]
LeadingZeros = true

; TODO add further global settings

; Write your wanted tags behind every block group the way you like it
; Order of tags is not required.

; H: Show on HUD
; T: Show in terminal
; I: Show in inventory
; N: Number all blocks, "Refinery = -N" leads to the refineries being named "Refinery 1", "Refinery 2", ...
; R: Renames the base name to a given string. Example: 'Refineries: -R "Smelter"' leads to all Refineries being named to 'Smelter' in addition to prefixes etc.
; B: Show in toolbar config
; S: Skips the whole block group. No block will be touched!

; Example: Refinery = -I -C -N -R "Smelter"
; All refineries are numbered, shown in the inventory and use the conveyor network. They are called "Smelter 1", "Smelter 2", ...
