; H: Show on HUD

; C: Use conveyor system  // TODO Usually always true, should I change the tag to only be needed if not wanted to use the conveyor? Would be more confusing.
; N: Number all blocks, "Refineries: -N" leads to the refineries being named "Refinery 1", "Refinery 2", ...
; R: Renames the base name to a given string. Example: 'Refineries: RG "Smelter"' leads to all Refineries being named to 'Smelter' in addition to prefixes etc.
; S: Skips the whole block group. No block will be touched!
; TODO add more, what is needed/wanted.

; Example: Refinery = -G -I -C -N -R "Smelter"
; All refineries are shown in the inventory and use the conveyor network. They are called "Smelter 1", "Smelter 2", ...
