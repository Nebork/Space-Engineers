[Nebork's Renaming Script]

; With this script it is possible to set a naming basis for an entire ship or a station at once and have all of the blocks named and set properly.
; It uses a tag system, meaning after every type of functional block you give the tags of how you want them to be named and which functions to set.
; Order of tags is not required.
; A list of all tags with description is given below


; H: Show on HUD
; T: Show in terminal
; I: Show in inventory
; C: Use conveyor system  // TODO Usually always true, should I change the tag to only be needed if not wanted to use the conveyor? Would be more confusing.
; N: Number all blocks, "Refineries: -N" leads to the refineries being named "Refinery 1", "Refinery 2", ...
; R: Renames the base name to a given string. Example: 'Refineries: RG "Smelter"' leads to all Refineries being named to 'Smelter' in addition to prefixes etc.
; TODO add more, what is needed/wanted. A parameter "S" "!" or something, ask the boys, which SKIPS renaming for this particular group
;
; Example: Refineries: -G -I -C -N -R "Smelter"
; All refineries are shown in the inventory and use the conveyor network. They are called "Smelter 1", "Smelter 2", ...

; Write your wanted tags behind every block group the way you like it
; Some groups combine other groups, e.g. "Large Cargoes" and "Small Cargoes" are also part of "All Cargoes".
; The settings work for all, however more specific groups overwrite the settings of less specific groups
; If "show on HUD" is on for "All Cargoes", but not for "Small Cargoes", it is set on for "Large Cargoes" and "Medium Cargoes", but not for "Small Cargoes"
