  #01 using System.Text.RegularExpressions;  // can be implemented, but the whole namespace is needed

  #02 Nebork's Renaming Script This script is used to rename every block uniformly in the control panel. 
      This is extremely useful, if you care about proper naming and organizing blocks WITHOUT having to rename 100+ blocks manually.

  #03 Used to go over every group

  #04  Stores all given data and handles renaming

  #05  Used in the custom data and to find the right group

  #06 maybe add indexer over block members to access every member

  #07 Settings processed from Command, see Process()

  #08 Constructor, adding it to the global variables

  #09 Initialises the list and puts in first block.

  #10 Main function. Renames every block in the group with the given settings.

  #11 creating futureName

  #12 Processes the settings from Command  // TODO finish

  #13 Checks if input is not valid, good luck with Regex :D

  #14 everything but the first 2 and the last char

  #15 Creates the blockGroups of the current state  TODO is dependent on workOnSubgrids. Just add parameter and filter allBlocks dependently

  #16 Clears both list of any old, unused members

  #17 Get all blocks and prepare for assignment to groups.

  #18 Loop to assign every block to a group or create a new one.

  #19 no group with this name found

  #20 there already is a group with this name, add the block

  #21 Generates the Custom Data based on the blockGroups

  #22 For just adding the block groups to the current custom data

  #23 add the check, that only NEW groups are added

  #24 Runs at the start of the game or every time it is recompiled (edit code or press recompile)
      Shall check and generate the custom data

  #25 Runs every time someone presses run. Shall fetch all the blocks and put them into the groups processes the command string and uses it to rename all the blocks of a group

  #26 maybe use update source to differentiate from run from program (fresh start) or run from command

  #27 _ini needed global?

  #28 Try to parse the ini

  #29 Read all settings

  #30 Loads the input for every block group

  #31 Main loop, iterates every block group and renames it according to their settings.



Custom Data:
  Instroduction
  With this script it is possible to set a naming basis for an entire ship or a station at once and have all of the blocks named and set properly.
  It uses a tag system, meaning after every type of functional block you give the tags of how you want them to be named and which functions to set.
  A list of all tags with description is given below

  GridName
  Defines the name of the grid which shall be renamed. If empty uses the grid of this programmable block.

  WorkOnSubgrids / USE WITH CAUTION
  Decides if all subgrids shall be renamed uniformely. [true/false]

  Prefix / Postfix (Suffix)
  Sets a pre-/postfix for every block. Advised to be different for every ship/station to properly identify every block. "" if nothing is wanted.

  LeadingZeros
  If true, adds leading zeros to numberings if the number of items is greater than 10. Leads to better sorting in terminal. [true/false]

  RomanNumerals
  If true, converts all numbering to roman numerals. Overwrites LeadingZeros. [true/false]

  BlockSettings
  Write your wanted tags behind every block group the way you like it
  Order of tags is not required.
